# Step Into My Office (SiMO)

##### Front-End Capstone for Nashville Software School Full-Stack Dev BootCamp

SiMO is the web-app for my Front-End capstone at Nashville Software School. Developed mainly with AngularJS, BootStrap and Firebase, this app is used to demonstrate the culmination of my skills in Front-End web development. SiMO is a Notes sharing app intended for high school and college students. You can choose files, add a comment and upload them. There is also a section for adding different classes as well as a real time chat for group study with other students.


## Getting Started
### -Setup & Installation-
